DATA DESCRIPTION FOR: [Figure 4]
-----------------------------------------

1. Number of variables: 2

2. Number of cases/rows: 5

3. Missing data codes: N/A
       
4. Variable List

    A. Name: <Mean unit water costs>
       Description: <This metric measures the cost level of water resources allocation within the watershed. It is calculated by dividing the total IGWM costs by the total amount of water supplied in the watershed.>
                    Value labels if appropriate

    B. Name: <Water allocation Gini coefficient>
       Description: <Water allocation Gini coefficient: This metric quantifies the equity level of water resources allocation within the watershed. It can be calculated using Equation 5a.>
                    Value labels if appropriate


-----------------------------------------
DATA DESCRIPTION FOR: [Figure 5]
-----------------------------------------

1. Number of variables: 2

2. Number of cases/rows: 5

3. Missing data codes: N/A
       
4. Variable List

    A. Name: <Mean ratio of available surface water>
       Description: <This metric assesses the extent of surface water usage for withdrawal within the watershed. It is determined by averaging the monthly ratio of available river storage levels for water withdrawal to the maximum theoretical storage levels in the watershed.>
                     Value labels if appropriate

    B. Name: <Ratio of water cycle>
       Description: <This metric measures the degree of urban stored water utilization by calculating the ratio of the total amount of water supplied to the total amount of urban stored water in a year.>
                     Value labels if appropriate
